# Purpose: Preprocess raw sequencing data (DADA2 pipeline).

# Quality filtering of reads (trimming, filtering, etc.).
# Learn error rates and perform sequence inference (DADA2).
# Generate and save ASV tables for 16S and ITS.
# Assign taxonomy to ASVs (e.g., using SILVA for 16S and UNITE for ITS).
